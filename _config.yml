  Turn your books into audiobooks. KeepReading - even when you can't read.

  You bought a great book, but there's no audiobook version. Or maybe you already own dozens of books you want to read - but between work, cooking, commuting, workouts, and everything else you're getting done, sitting down with a book just doesn't fit the flow. Turn any physical book into audiobook and KeepReading!

  Photograph the pages of any book with your phone, and KeepReading creates a fully navigable audiobook complete with auto-detected chapters and progress tracking. Listen while cooking, commuting, working out, or doing chores. Your books, finally integrated into your active life.
